### Who we are

Most of us are working in the [fusion chair](http://fusion.cs.uni-jena.de/fusion/) of the University of Jena, Germany. We develop BExIS 2. We provide data management for several biodiversity research programms in Germany.

### About BEXIS 2

[BEXIS 2] (http://bexis2.uni-jena.de/) is a free and open source software supporting researchers in managing their data throughout the entire data life cycle from data collection, documentation, processing, analyzing, to sharing and publishing research data. BEXIS 2 has a lot of core data management [features](http://bexis2.uni-jena.de/bexis2-software/features/) and first [modules] (https://github.com/bexis)  enhance it with additional research project components.
