## Welcome to our GSoC 2019 Idea List
Here you can find our Idea List for the Google Summer of Code (GSoC). Check the [GSoC main site](http://code.google.com/soc) for general information about the program, how to apply, timeline, faq, and more. 

### How to get in touch with us
If you have any questions simply write a mail to our dev-mailing list: bexis2-dev AT listserv.uni-jena.de

### Who we are
Most of us are working in the [fusion chair](http://fusion.cs.uni-jena.de/fusion/) of the University of Jena, Germany. We develop (not only) BEXIS 2 which serves as data manangement platform for a [couple of research projects](http://bexis2.uni-jena.de/community/partners-instances/) in Germany. We work on semantic technologies. We do data management for several biodiversity research programms in Germany.

### About [BEXIS 2](http://bexis2.uni-jena.de/)
![BEXIS2](http://bexis2.uni-jena.de/wp-content/themes/theme-BexisTheme/images/logo.jpg) is a free and open source software supporting researchers in managing their data throughout the entire data life cycle. BEXIS 2 has a lot of core data management [features](http://bexis2.uni-jena.de/bexis2-software/features/) supporting the [FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and first [modules](https://github.com/bexis) enhancing it with additional components.

To strenghten the operation of BEXIS 2 within the data community we propose a set of ideas and would be very happy to welcome new collaborators.
