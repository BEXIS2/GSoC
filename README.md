## Welcome to our GSoC 2019 Idea List
Here you can find our Idea List for the Google Summer of Code (GSoC). Check the [GSoC main site](http://code.google.com/soc) for general information about the program, how to apply, timeline, faq, and more. 

### How to get in touch with us
If you have any questions simply write a mail to our mailing list: bexis-support AT uni-jena.de

### Who we are
Most of us are working in the [fusion chair](http://fusion.cs.uni-jena.de/fusion/) of the University of Jena, Germany. We develop (not only) BEXIS 2 which serves as data manangement platform for a [couple of research projects](http://bexis2.uni-jena.de/community/partners-instances/) in Germany. We work on semantic technologies. We do data management for several biodiversity research programms in Germany.

### About [BEXIS 2](http://bexis2.uni-jena.de/)
![BEXIS2](http://bexis2.uni-jena.de/wp-content/themes/theme-BexisTheme/images/logo.jpg) is a free and open source software supporting researchers in managing their data throughout the entire data life cycle. BEXIS 2 has a lot of core data management [features](http://bexis2.uni-jena.de/bexis2-software/features/) supporting the [FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and first [modules](https://github.com/bexis) enhancing it with additional components.

To strenghten the operation of BEXIS 2 within the data community we propose a set of ideas and would be very happy to welcome new collaborators. 

## Idea List

1. Dataset Findability
Finding relevant data is getting more and more important for scholars. Apart from conventional data portals, external search providers such as Google also offer first search applications over datasets. In order to better find and index BEXIS 2 data, the idea of this project is to enrich BEXIS2 metadata with additional information based on vocabulary such as schema.org, bioschema.org, DCAT, â€¦ That will allow external search providers to index and display open BEXIS 2 data properly and enhance the visibility of that datasets.
Outcomes: Enriched html for every dataset page
Skillset: Html, JavaScript, MarkupLanguages
Possible mentors: Martin, Felicitas
Project complexity: Easy
